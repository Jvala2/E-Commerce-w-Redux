# <E-Commerce-w-Redux>

## Description

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/Liscense-MIT-blue.svg "License Badge")

I needed to flex my ability to recode something using Redux.

So I updated a dire out of date app I created a while ago on github. Now this thing actually functions and tracks even better than before!

This project, similar to the first one is intended to showcase a frontend that is functional as opposed to the backend deployed  here! https://github.com/Jvala2/E-Commerce-Demo

While creating this, I have to say that I honed my ability to tackle deployment errors.
